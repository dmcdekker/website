                <h2>Project</h2>     
                    <p>To develop a compelling ecommerce site that provides detailed, expert information 
                    to customers who want to purchase developmentally appropriate and educational toys for 
                    children [individuals] aged 0 to 99.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>In order to surmise whether our project would be successful, we examined the
                    anatomy of the modern educational toy website and surveyed fifty-five participants.
                    Specifically, we were interested in people's motivation for purchasing toys online.
                    According to our survey results, a high percentage of respondents still bought toys 
                    in brick and mortar stores, which gave us the green light to move forward. Respondents 
                    also told us what was important to them: customer reviews over expert recommendations, 
                    quick and easy checkout, and products ranked by customer recommendation. These responses 
                    formed the core of us creating a user-friendly website

                    <p>To present the website in a professional manner, we used Wix.com to mock up the pages, which were
                    then copied to a prototype using Azure.</p>
