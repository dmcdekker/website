                <h2>Project</h2>     
                    <p>To develop a compelling ecommerce site that provides detailed, expert information 
                    to customers who want to purchase developmentally appropriate and educational toys for 
                    children [individuals] aged 0 to 99. </p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>In order to evaluate the potential success of our project, we examined the
                    anatomy of the modern educational toy website and surveyed fifty-five participants.
                    Specifically, we were interested in people's motivation for purchasing toys online.
                    According to our survey results, a high percentage of respondents still bought toys 
                    in brick and mortar stores, which gave us the green light to move forward. Respondents 
                    also told us what was important to them: customer reviews over expert recommendations, 
                    quick and easy checkout, and products ranked by customer recommendation. These responses 
                    formed the core of us creating a user-friendly website</p>
   
                <h2>Personas</h2>
                    <p>Based on the profiles of participants from the data collected, we created personas to understand the varying needs of potential customers.
                      For example, the professional who wants to buy quality toys for her nephews and nieces, or the single mom who doesn't have time
                      to shop, or grandparents who need hints. The personas kept us tied to the needs of potential users and their level of facility with 
                      technology.

                <h2>Use Model</h2>
                    <p>Once personas were formed, we chose tasks that our research indicated users would execute and mapped out the website with a Use Model to see how each component connected globally
                    and locally. Our Use Model traced the flow of three user tasks, specifically: browse, buy in three clicks, and write a review.
                     </p>

                <h2>Wireframe</h2>
                    <p> Wireframes tested the flows created in the Use Model. Acting as users we tested our three scenarios to see if they would behave as predicted. 
                    Of course they didnâ€™t which led to us going through several versions of the use model until it matched expectations.</p>
                
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                    <p>To present the website in a professional manner, we used Wix.com to mock up the pages, which were
                    then copied to a prototype using Azure.</p>
                
                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                    <p>Axure, Google Forms, Google draw-io, NinjaMock</p>    
          
                <h2>Final Result</h2>
                    <p>Overall, the website turned out well with good functionality and we achieved all of our goals outlined within User Stories. Thank you to Oaggin
