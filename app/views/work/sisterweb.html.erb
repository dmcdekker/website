                <p>SisterWeb was the first web project I worked on in a software engineering class at Mills College. SisterWeb was 
                 born from our groups' desire to have a platform where women in tech could interact, connect, and find support. For our final
                 project, the goal was to produce a social website that users could log into and interact with each other using direct log in and third-party authentication.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>As the Front End Developer, each page was styled as it came in. There was no formal CSS/HTML instruction; I learned everything on the fly. 
                     About a month into the project, I realized that I hadnâ€™t formatted Bootstrap correctly in the application file, so the 
                     entire site ended up being entirely hand coded. Also, for the allotted timeframe of a semester, we definitely bit off more
                     that we had time to complete! In the beginning, we devised a much more complex site than we ended up producing.</p>
            <br>
                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                    <p>In addition to Ruby on Rails, CSS, HAML, Cloud 9, Pivotal Tracking, and Heroku, we used the Agile process to plan and develop
                    our site.</p>
            <br>
                <h2>Final Result</h2>
                    <p>Overall, the website turned out well with good functionality.</p>
