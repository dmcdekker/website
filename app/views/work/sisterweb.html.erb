                <h2>Project</h2>     
                    <p>SisterWeb was born from our groups' desire to have a platform where women in tech could interact, connect, and find support. For our final
                     project, the goal was to produce a social website that users could log into and interact with each other using direct log in or third-party authentication. 
                     Using the Agile process, we implemented User Stories that centered around creating profiles, a calendar, and a way to create questions or comments
                     that individual users could interact with.
                     
                    </p>
            <br>
                
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>As the Front End Developer, each page was styled as it came in. There was no formal CSS/HTML instruction; I learned everything on the fly. 
                     About a month into the project, I realized that I hadnâ€™t formatted Bootstrap correctly in the application file, so the 
                     entire site ended up being entirely hand coded. Also, for the allotted timeframe of a semester, we definitely bit off more
                     that we had time to complete! In the beginning, we devised a much more complex site than we ended up producing. I additionally
                     filled the role of Product Manager, keeping our team on track with its goals and documenting progress via Pivotal Tracker.</p>
            <br>
                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                    <p>In addition to Ruby on Rails, CSS, HAML, Cloud 9, Pivotal Tracker, Piazza, and Heroku, we used the Agile process to plan and develop
                    our site.</p>
            <br>
                <h2>Final Result</h2>
                    <p>Overall, the website turned out well with good functionality and we achieved all the goals outlined within our User Stories. </p>
