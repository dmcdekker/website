                <h2>Product Manager Intern</h2>     
                    <p>4Bells is a first responder mobile application from Caravan Studios. 4Bells matches volunteers with time-sensitive tasks, like delivering important documents, picking up a dog from the pound, or deploying volunteers after a disaster. 
                    It enables group leaders to connect easily with volunteers, create tasks, and monitor who has signed up to complete tasks. As the Product Developer intern, my job was to redesign the UI and improve app functionality.
                    In addition, Caravan Studios wanted the app to incorporate web accessibility features. 
            
                    </p>
              <br>        
                     
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Because the color palette was already established, working with accessibility guidelines for the first time was challenging. 
                    During the design process, I had to figure out how to keep the original colors while simultaneously allowing for sufficent contrast. Unfortunately,
                    many of the colors had to change to meet WCAG guidelines; fortunately, the WCAG website has many wonderful tools that make selecting the right colors easy.
                    One of the ways I resolved not having to change everything was to put a box with a lighter color around text areas. 
                    </p>
              <br>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I began with personas and use models to ensure that I thoroughly understood the app, its capabilities, and audience. Because Caravan want the app to 
                meet Web Accessibility standards, I read and studied material online and found the BBC guidelines for mobile application development the most comprehensive
                and helpful.
                <br>
                <p>
                For example, the original UI looked like this. </p>
                <div class="container-fluid"
                       <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-xs-6 col-lg-4">
                                <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dmcdekker/image/upload/v1488926177/task1_rukkao.png" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" class="thumbnail img-responsive" size: "60%">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-xs-6 col-lg-4">
                                <img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dmcdekker/image/upload/v1488926177/task2_dzpsy0.png" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" class="thumbnail img-responsive" size: "60%">
                            </div>
                            
                        </div>

    
                    <p>The new UI has clear tabs for each task category with no swiping/sliding and all task categories are displayed clearly. Tabs change color when pressed from a white text
                    with gray background to a white text on black background and orange stripe. Also, if the task in the open section is clicked on, the color will change, giving
                    the user feedback. A menu item, with links to tips, is now on the top right hand corner. Also, the bottom navigation bar now has words instead of nebulous icons, creating clarity for the user;
                     in addition, the buttons at the bottom of the screen change color to show the user which screen they are in.</p>
