            <p>SisterWeb was the first web project I worked on in a software engineering class at Mills College. For our final
             project, the goal to produce a social website that users could log into and interact with each other. SisterWeb was 
             born from our groups' desire to have a platform where women could interact, connect, and find support. </p>
