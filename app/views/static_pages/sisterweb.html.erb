                <p>SisterWeb was the first web project I worked on in a software engineering class at Mills College.  SisterWeb was 
                 born from our groups' desire to have a platform where women could interact, connect, and find support. For our final
                 project, the goal was to produce a social website that users could log into and interact with each other. As the Front End
                 Developer, each page was styled as it came in. There was no formal CSS/HTML instruction; I learned everything on the fly. 
                 About a month into the project, I realized that I hadnâ€™t formatted Bootstrap correctly in the application file, so the 
                 entire site ended up being entirely hand coded. In accordance with class guidelines and the SaaS textbook we used, HAML 
                 and extension .scss were used to style the front end.
