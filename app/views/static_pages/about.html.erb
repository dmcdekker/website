            <p>I'm Denise M. Dekker, a Scottish transplant who has lived in the Bay Area for twenty-two years. Approximately 
               three years ago, I left a long career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. Until taking 
               a beginning programming class in Python, I was on track to major in Communication. 
               I will graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Computer Science. 
              
               I’m passionate about the convergence of design, usability, and user experience. My goal upon graduating 
               is to work as a web developer or front end engineer.
