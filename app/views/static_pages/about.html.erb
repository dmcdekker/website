            <p>Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, my name is Denise M. Dekker and I have lived in the Bay Area since 1994.
               Approximately three years ago, I left a long career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. 
               Until taking a beginning programming class in Python in my final semester at Laney Community College, I was on 
               track to major in Communication, which changed immediately after learning how to code. After being accepted to 
               Mills College in Oakland, I decided to major in Computer Science and will graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. 
               <br>
               <br>
               I’m passionate about the convergence of design, usability, and user experience. My goal upon graduating 
               is to work as a Front End Engineer or Developer.
