                    <p>Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, I've lived in the Bay Area since 1994.
                       Four years ago, I left a career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. 
                       Until taking a beginning programming class in Python during my final semester at Laney Community College, I was on 
                       track to major in Communication, which changed immediately after learning how to code. After being accepted to 
                       Mills College in Oakland, I took a leap and decided to major in Computer Science and graduated in May 2017.</p>

                   <p>Iâ€™m passionate about the convergence of design, accessibility, and user experience, and my professional goal is to work in a user-facing role that utilizes my varied skill set.
                   I believe that everyone should have an exceptional experience with web and mobile technologies, and am inspired to develop solutions that create equity in access and functionality.
