        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, I've lived in the Bay Area since 1994.
               Four years ago, I left a career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. 
               Until taking a beginning programming class in Python during my final semester at Laney Community College, I was on 
               track to major in Communication, which changed immediately after learning how to code. After being accepted to 
               Mills College in Oakland, I took a leap and decided to major in Computer Science.
               I will graduate from Mills in May 2017 with a B.A. in Computer Science. 
               In addition to being a full-time student, I'm a produce geek, avid chef, and sometime DJ for events at my daughter's school.
               <br>
               <br>
               I’m passionate about the convergence of design, usability, and user experience, and my goal upon graduating is to work as a Product Manager or Developer.
               Check out my work page! I have worked on a variety of projects as Front End Dev and UX/UI designer.
