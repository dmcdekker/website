                <p>Originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, I've lived in the Bay Area since 1994.
                   Four years ago, I left a career in sustainable agriculture to complete my bachelor's degree. 
                   Until taking a beginning programming class in Python during my final semester at Laney Community College, I was on 
                   track to major in Communication, which changed immediately after learning how to code. After being accepted to 
                   Mills College in Oakland, I took a leap and decided to major in Computer Science and graduate in May 2017.</p>

               <p>In addition to being a full-time student, I'm a produce geek, avid chef, and sometime DJ for events at my daughter's school.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12 text-center">        
               <p>I’m passionate about the convergence of design, accessibility, and user experience, and my goal upon graduating is to work as a Product Manager or Developer.
               Check out my work page! I have worked on a variety of projects as a Front End Developer and UX/UI designer. I'm inspired to
               create equity in access and believe that everyone should have an exceptional experience with web and mobile technologies.</p>
